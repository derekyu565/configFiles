## Vial 
Keyboard mappings for boards that I own.

Corne -> A 42 key ergonomic true-split keyboard. A 40% Keyboard as well.

Reviung41 -> It wishes to be a Corne keyboard. "Split" keyboard. Also a 40% Keyboard.

## Steam Deck
So far I only have my preset.conf

I only customized the first preset to basically display similar metrics from the second preset but adding a clock on the display.
